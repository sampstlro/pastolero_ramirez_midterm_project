  <p>Subaru is a global transportation manufacturer with two main businesses: automobiles and aircraft.
    Subaru started out as Nakajima Aircraft Company, founded in 1917, just 14 years after the Wright brothers succeeded in the first powered flight in 1903.
    By 1953, when we embarked on a new start as Fuji Heavy Industries, our automotive division had matured into its driving force.Since then, we have released original cars which design is highly and creative known for the Subaru 360, the Legacy, and more.Since changing the company name to Subaru Corporation in 2017, we have deepened our ties with customers by creating new technological value.
    The aerospace business leads the Japanese aerospace industry and has a proven track record in the development and production of a wide variety of aircraft.</p>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Why You Should Choose Subaru.</h2>
          <em>Advanced safety as standard, We began performing collision tests back in the early 1960s, long before industry-wide crash testing was required. Today, all Subaru SUVs plus Levorg and Impreza have the maximum 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating.At Subaru, we adopt a ‘no compromises’ approach to automotive design. Everything we do, we do because we believe it’s absolutely the best way to build a car. </em>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Built to perform.</h2>
          <em>Subaru vehicles are well-known for their relentless capability – and that’s down to the expert engineering that underpins them.
            For decades, we’ve built our vehicles on Subaru’s unique always-on Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive (SAWD) system. Permanent SAWD comes as standard on Forester, XV, Outback, Levorg and Impreza. Combined with a Boxer engine, it gives the driver maximum confidence and control by continuously shifting power to the wheels that have the most grip – to ensure exceptional traction and excellent road-holding, on or off-road and in any weather.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Innovative. Independent. Individual.</h2>
        <em>These three words epitomise our attitude as a brand. We don’t do anything unnecessarily – and we don’t shy away from doing things differently to provide the best possible driving experience for our customers and their passengers.
          Take a Subaru test drive and you’ll see what we mean. Whether you’re getting to grips with Forester, XV or Outback on potentially wet or slippery country lanes or prefer to put an Impreza or Levorg through its paces during a cruise along a dual carriageway, we’re confident you’ll be impressed (and walk away with a smile on your face).</em>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Driving confidence. Every day, everywhere.</h2>
        <em>We have a long and proud history of automotive excellence – delivering impressive performance on and off road, all around the world.
          All that experience means that, whatever the weather or road conditions, Subaru’s core technologies enable our cars to live up to our brand’s exceptional standards of delivering outstanding safety, capability and reliability at all times.</em>
