The company was founded by Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson in 1927, and the first vehicle ever produced was the ÖV4, nicknamed Jakob. Renowned for their years of leadership in automotive safety, Volvo Cars was purchased by the Ford Motor Company and remained part of their Premier Automotive brands from 1999 to 2010. The automaker is now owned by Geely Automobile, a major automotive brand based in China. Geely Motors' headquarters are in Shanghai; however, Volvo Cars remains headquartered in Torslanda in Gothenburg, Sweden. Volvo Cars has manufacturing plants in Sweden, Belgium, China, and recently opened their first manufacturing facility in the United States, in South Carolina.</p>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Why You Should Choose Volvo</h2>
          <em>The automotive market is more competitive than ever these days, but Volvo still stands out. Volvo models offer many unique benefits that cars from other manufacturers do not offer. The many benefits offered by Volvo vehicles include impressive off-road ability, groundbreaking safety features, turbocharged power and economy, elegant Swedish design, and leading practicality. Read on to learn more about the many reasons that you should buy a Volvo vehicle.</em>

        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Off-Road Ability.</h2>
          <em>One of the first things that comes to mind for many people when they think of Volvo is off-road ability. Many Volvo vehicles offer advanced all-wheel drive systems that provide enhanced off-road capability. Of course, these same all-wheel drive systems also provide a higher level of traction when you're driving in inclement weather conditions like snow or rain. The Volvo all-wheel drive systems can even provide improved performance on the road. Greater traction means that your Volvo vehicle can get more of its power down, no matter what the road conditions may be like where you are.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Safety Features</h2>
          <em>While off-road capability is likely one of the first things that you think of when you consider Volvo vehicles, cutting-edge safety may be the absolute first thing you think of. Volvo has long been known for offering vehicles with class-leading safety features, and this trend has certainly continued with the current model lineup. All current Volvo vehicles come standard with rearview cameras. Also, many Volvo vehicles have features like lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning, emergency brake assist, and much more. Volvo remains committed to advancing the safety technology in its vehicles, so there will continue to be cutting-edge safety features in all Volvo models.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Turbocharged Power & Economy</h2>
          <em>Many Volvo vehicles in the current model lineup either come standard with a turbocharged engine or offer an optional turbocharged engine. Volvo has embraced turbocharging for two main reasons. First, it boosts the power and performance of the engines in many Volvo models. Secondly, these engines retain similar fuel economy and emissions numbers as naturally aspirated engines of the same size. It is important to note that larger naturally aspirated engines, while producing roughly the same power as the current turbocharged engines, would get lower fuel economy ratings and put out more pollution. Volvo is always looking for ways to enhance driving enjoyment without sacrificing environmental friendliness, so turbocharging is the perfect solution.</em>
