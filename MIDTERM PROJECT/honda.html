  <p>Honda Motor Company, Ltd., Japanese Honda Giken Kōgyō KK, leading Japanese manufacturer of motorcycles and a major producer of automobiles for the world market. Headquarters are in Tokyo. Since 1959 it has been the top-selling motorcycle company in the world.
  The engineer Honda Soichiro founded the Honda Technical Research Institute near Hamamatsu in 1946 to develop small, efficient internal-combustion engines. It was incorporated as Honda Motor Company in 1948 and began producing motorcycles in 1949. The Honda C-100, a small-engine motorcycle, was introduced in 1953. In 1959 the company established a U.S. subsidiary, the American Honda Motor Company, which began producing motorcycles in the United States in 1979 and automobiles in 1982. In 1969 Honda introduced the popular CB750, the first “superbike,” which had a 750-cc engine, disc brakes, and an electric starter.</p>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Why You Should Choose Honda.</h2>
          <em>To buy a Honda is a great investment, and it’s likely you’ll be spending your money sensibly in regards to fuel economy, reliability, resale value, and quality workmanship. This Japanese automaker has been producing exceptional vehicles for nearly seven decades, and since its beginning, it has consistently won awards and topped the charts in virtually every category.</em>

        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Award Winning Company.</h2>
          <em>The Honda Motor Company has won more Car and Driver Top Manufacturer Awards than any other brand on the market. They have received this honor 80 times, which is more than double Toyota’s second-place standing of 38. The Civic, Fit, and Accord have made the “10 Best Cars” list several times. In fact, Honda Accord has achieved this status an amazing 27 times! In addition, the Odyssey and Pilot have been on the “10 Best Truck” list 7 and 6 times respectively. The award list for Honda apart from Car and Driver is also extensive, including such titles as the “Best Buy Award”, “Greenest Automaker”, “Best Overall Non-luxury Brand”, and “Top Safety Pick”.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Reliability</h2>
        <em> Honda is synonymous with quality and dependability. They have earned the “Most Trusted Brand” Award and consumer reports routinely rank many models at the top of the list for reliability and workmanship. The 2010 Crosstour won the J.D. Power Award for vehicle dependability, and a customer survey has ranked the manufacturer number one for reliability eight years running. Hondas are built to last, and the fact that there are so many available on the used car market is a testament to the fact that this company continually produces quality vehicles.</em>

        <div class="carousel-item">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Fuel Efficient</h2>
        <em>When it comes to building fuel-efficient vehicles, Honda is definitely an industry leader. There are several models that receive 30+ MPG on the highway and the Honda brand boasts an average of more than 25 MPG for off-highway or city driving. For even better fuel economy, Honda also has a great selection of hybrid models to choose from.</em>
